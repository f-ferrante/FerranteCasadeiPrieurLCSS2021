Code for the example in Ferrante Casadei Prieur 2021

The code needs to be used as follows: 

1- Run the file Design.m, this defines the plant data and designs the coupling  ain via the results presented in the paper.  
2- Go into the subfolder Simulaiton and run the file Run.m. This simulates the networked system with the coupling obtained obtained at point 1 and generates the components of trajectoty x(t,z) in the form of a matrix compatible with "surf" and "mesh" instructions. Moreover, the code automatically plots the average spatial errors presented in the paper.
